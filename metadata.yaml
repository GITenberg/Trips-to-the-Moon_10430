description: 'Lucian of Samosata was an Assyrian rhetorician and satirist who wrote
  in the Greek language. He is noted for his witty and scoffing nature. Trips to the
  Moon contains three of his works: Instructions for Writing History, The True History,
  Icaro-Menippus - A Dialogue. Lucian was one of the first novelists in occidental
  civilization. In A True Story, a fictional narrative work written in prose, he parodied
  some fantastic tales told by Homer in the Odyssey and some feeble fantasies that
  were popular in his time ...'
